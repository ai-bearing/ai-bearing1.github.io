# Blog-ish
## What this is
This is less of a typical blog and more an online journal where I write down my thoughts on various things that are on my mind at that period in time. I'm going to try to update this regularly. I will try to keep profanity to a minimum, but readers are advised that there will probably be a nonzero amount of profanity.

First full day back home, and I am not really enjoying it. Everything is very boring but also there's that typical feeling of a coming mountain of work that I am currently procrastinating on (namely, REU applications), which I have yet to do substantial work on for some reason. However, I'll survive.

I'm somewhat sad that I won't be able to complete Advent of Code this year. It's just absurdly hard, but also I feel like it's supposed to be somewhat "basic" when it comes to the difficulty of programming challenges. Unfortunately, I'm not particularly adept at programming or programming thought processes, and as a result wasn't able to make it past Day 7.

I am done with finals, and with the end of finals I have finished my final formal physics class for the forseeable future. It's not like I'm *bad* at physics, but I just didn't really enjoy it and weirdly enough doesn't feel particularly real. I know I'm majoring in math and econ, two of the most abstract subjects, but even then physics feels like it takes way too many assumptions

My econ final went without a hitch, thank god. Micro is a pretty weird subject and I was sure the professor would be able to find a way to mess up our senses, but thankfully everything was for the most part sane. I actually ended up getting three of my predictions correct (there was a moving decision with labor supply, an exchange economies question, and a public goods question). I finished the test early but I did read over every question again just to make sure I didn't mess up badly, and I think (god willing) I will end up with an A in the class. Much better result than topology, but also Intermediate Micro isn't an upper div class.

#### Classes and Finals
My mind is still very, very dead from making the economics notes and also working through the practice finals Prof. Ngo gave to us. Additionally, a lot of stuff went wrong on my topology exam, mostly stemming from a complete and utter inability to think during the exam period. I was sure I had eaten enough and even drank chocolate milk during the exam, but the questions were a mixture of curveballs, tedious problems, and the fact that I just didn't prepare for some of the problems. Might be my first B in a math class, which would suck, but I guess the bright side is that I'm done with the class. Even though I really did love the professor, there was just a lot of stuff going on in my life that the completion of the class is a good sign that stuff should (inshallah) become better.

The econ notes are pretty thorough (except for consumer theory — I mostly made this set of notes to double down on producer theory and monopolies). I think the final exam should have some mixture of the following:

- exchange economies question with utility maximization
- non-standard budget constraint or moving decision
- economic rent/situation with different types of producers
- public goods

I think my main issue with the exchange economies question on the practice exams was that I tried to work too fast. Of course, we are allotted three whole hours to take the final exam, which means that (theoretically speaking), I should be fine on the exam as long as I don't suddenly get the urge to leave as soon as possible.

#### Thoughts on Gentrification and Exclusion
In Los Angeles, there's often talk about "gentrification" (usually a signifier for neighborhood change, typically identified with new housing development, different restaurants, and rising rents) that's leading to people having to leave their communities, with much of the blame placed on the tech industry or new private market rate housing. Of course, I fall firmly on the side that gentrification — to the extent that it's a discussion about rising rents — is resolved via mass construction of housing ([here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3867764) [are](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/doi/10.1162/rest_a_01055/100977/Local-Effects-of-Large-New-Apartment-Buildings-in) [some](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fer/wpaper/146.html) [papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3426103) showing that mass construction of housing does lead to decreasing rents both at the hyperlocal level and at the regional level).   

I'm extremely irked by people who believe that gentrification is a problem because of culture or demographic shifts, and even if we resolved the fundamental economic problem of housing scarcity, that gentrification would still be bad. We would call an Ohio steelworker who is opposed to immigration liberalization because of nonsense fears such as "they'll take our jobs" or "immigrants degrade American culture" as rightly xenophobic, but all of a sudden arguments of a similar vein applied to the hyper-local level are valid if they're being made by a person of color.

Is this a bit strawman-y? Perhaps, but I do think that accepting demographic change and living with people of different races, backgrounds, and ethnicities is just a part of life. If activists think that gentrification is bad because of rising rents, then they should support mass housing construction — if they think it's bad because of demographic and cultural shifts, then their belief is fundamentally based in exclusion, but just for the "right people."
