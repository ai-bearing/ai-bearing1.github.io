## What this is
This is less of a typical blog and more an online journal where I write down my thoughts on various things that are on my mind at that period in time. I'm going to try to update this regularly. I will try to keep profanity to a minimum, but readers are advised that there will probably be a nonzero amount of profanity.

Unfortunately, my planned statistics class was cancelled, so I'm taking a class on public education in Los Angeles instead. However, my other classes so far seem to be going well (Intermediate Macro and Graph Theory). I'm looking forward to a productive-ish semester.

I have a campus job for next semester lined up, let's go. If things go well, I will be the grader for Intermediate Micro (all 30-ish students, too). I think this is going to be a very long set of grading assignments, unfortunately, but hopefully this means I'll have a lot of money at the end of the semester.

Additionally, unfortunately I have not retained the momentum for the R workthrough — the siren song of lounging around during break was too strong, I am sorry to say.

New Year, New Book(s) to read. I finished *The Tyranny of Experts*, and I really liked it. It's a great overview of not only the history of "development economics" as a concept, but also how the application of technocratic development distracts from the rights of the poor and the problems of dictators. One of my favorite parts was the section on the development history of Greene Street in NYC — I think we need more vignettes/microhistories of different famous streets. For example, I think one on the history of Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles or Market Street in San Francisco would be very welcome. 

Additionally, I started on my R workthrough (you can see my progress [here](NSP_R_Workthrough.md)), using the No Starch Press guide. I'm mostly doing this because I have a lot of spare time in my remaining days of winter break (with REU apps interspersed, of course). Hopefully I'll maintain a good momentum towards the end of break and return to classes.

I like to dabble in speed solving Rubik's cubes, and I'm actually pretty decent — most of my Ao5s are around 17 to 18 seconds, and I usually consider solves above 20 seconds "bad." What's fascinating to me is that when I started speedcubing (as in, deliberately trying to solve the Rubik's cube in a fast method, rather than just learning how to solve it), I probably would have greatly rejoiced at such a result. After all, I was averaging around 30 to 40 seconds at the beginning of learning the CFOP method, and yet now I'm averaging half those results.

I think this is actually a very interesting allegory for the broader world — we have become so much more well off and so much more socially tolerant compared to 20 or 50 years ago that pining for "the good old days," while extremely common, is very silly. When was "the good old days?" The 1970s, when we still had rampant racism in the United States? The 1950s, when segregation was still legal? The 1920s, when we banned immigration from much of the world thanks to eugenicist beliefs? Not to forget that during this time, we were also much, much poorer than we are now — no refrigerators, few TVs (especially not UHD TVs), more hunger, fewer opportunities for education, etc.

This New Year's Week, I'm thankful for economic and social progress — here's to much, much more in the future. Hopefully I'll be able to regale my future children or grandchildren with stories about the bad old days when we needed to carry our backpacks on our backs instead of being able to use levitation devices.

I'm a bit over halfway through *The Tyranny of Experts* by William Easterly, and I'm liking a lot about it so far. The main sticking points are as follows:
- Knowledge problem: central planners don't know the solutions, we need to let free individuals experiment and try different things out to find out what the solution is
- Technocratic/autocratic development won out in the west (despite a history of free development) thanks to racism and a deluded belief that the knowledge problem surely could not apply to them
- Many of the worst problems in the developing world are not simply technocratic in nature, but rather stem from a lack of political and economic rights on the part of the poor. Letting the idea that we just don't have the right technologies distract us from the rights violations going on is a grave mistake.
- The solution is always and everywhere freedom, not support for tyrannical and repressive governments.
- Slavery was really, really freaking bad.

Sadly, I don't think Easterly's preferred policies would be widely supported among the "experts" that dominate modern-day conversations about, well, anything. The book is a grave indictment of belief in experts (hence its name), and as an aspiring expert (albeit not in economic development), I think humility is the hardest lesson of them all. We could always be wrong — we are not immune to propaganda, prevailing beliefs, and there could always be a different answer on the horizon.

Observed Christmas Day it is, and what a very gloomy [week ahead](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/999492574916116503/1057199186862420008/image.png). Obviously this is better than some of the horror stories coming out of the Northeast or Midwest from the past few days (sub-freezing temperatures and all), and thank god I live in the Bay Area instead of those dreadful places. Nonetheless, I do probably need to get some outside sooner or later, considering I haven't really left the house in a few days.

Merry Christmas! I sadly did not get a present at this moment (mostly because my parents are not really the Christmas present giving types, but I will be getting an iPhone sometime in the future if all goes well). Most everyone knows that [gift giving is inefficient](https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/12/21/14032662/christmas-gift-giving-wasteful), but did you know that [gift giving is falling](https://archive.ph/D1GdQ) as incomes are rising? In other words, gift giving is an inferior "good" (inferior service?)

Sidenote: I never really liked the term "inferior good" to denote goods whose consumption falls as incomes rise. After all, if a consumer is consuming a good, it means they think that good is superior to all the other types of goods they might have consumed. Sadly, economists are obsessed with terminology lest they get left in the dust by mathematicians and physicists, so they decided to call them "inferior goods" instead of "goods with negative income effect." The term "Giffen good" (for goods whose demand curve is upward sloping) is fine, though, because it's alliterative.

Anyway, I am actually pretty heartened by the fall of gift giving — it means we're wealthy enough that we don't think we necessarily need gifts, and we are humble enough to know that we don't really have the knowledge to give someone exactly what they want. If only we realized this earlier and decided to give each other cash instead.

There is a *lot* of haze in the Bay Area, which shines a light into a lot of political failures in the entirety of the state of California. There were no wildfires, and at any rate it's winter so there shouldn't be any wildfires — the reason for this haze is wood smoke from fireplaces and wood-burning stoves, paired with an inversion weather pattern that keeps the smoke down near the surface.

Wood burning stoves? Fireplaces? Is this the 1800s? No — it is simply the government of California being too spineless to allow upgraded housing with better insulation and heating and ban fireplaces in the process. One might think we would have a good set of conscious policies to facilitate the gradual removal of fireplaces through recycling of housing stock, but we don't because new apartments would use up people's street parking or something — instead we use unenforceable "Spare the Air" alerts that advise people to not burn wood. Of course there are prime examples of [solidarity in action](https://www.econlib.org/solidarity/), but imminent blackouts is much more conducive to solidaristic action than temporarily hazy air.

I do wish there was a solution to this, because, well, I want to go outside and do exercise, but in the meantime we can only do Spare the Air alerts.

Yoo I got an A in physics. And that's the last time I will take a physics class too. I don't have any ill will towards physics majors, but it's really just that I don't enjoy the subject.

I also have to start writing REU essays, my adjustment period from getting back home should mostly be over by tomorrow. I think the plan is to apply to the following, with preference in rough order of the following:

- Baruch (Discrete Math REU)
- Northwestern (Dynamics)
- Oregon State (Number Theory)
- University of Virginia (Topology)
- Williams College (Commutative Algebra)
- University of Michigan (Topic TBD)
- University of Minnesota (Algebra, Combinatorics, and Representation Theory)

There are certainly others that I want to apply to, especially considering that the chance that I'll get into one of these is probably small, but I really want to get into Baruch or Northwestern, considering they're in the largest and third largest metro areas in the country respectively.

First full day back home, and I am not really enjoying it. Everything is very boring but also there's that typical feeling of a coming mountain of work that I am currently procrastinating on (namely, REU applications), which I have yet to do substantial work on for some reason. However, I'll survive.

I'm somewhat sad that I won't be able to complete Advent of Code this year. It's just absurdly hard, but also I feel like it's supposed to be somewhat "basic" when it comes to the difficulty of programming challenges. Unfortunately, I'm not particularly adept at programming or programming thought processes, and as a result wasn't able to make it past Day 7.

I am done with finals, and with the end of finals I have finished my final formal physics class for the forseeable future. It's not like I'm *bad* at physics, but I just didn't really enjoy it and weirdly enough doesn't feel particularly real. I know I'm majoring in math and econ, two of the most abstract subjects, but even then physics feels like it takes way too many assumptions

My econ final went without a hitch, thank god. Micro is a pretty weird subject and I was sure the professor would be able to find a way to mess up our senses, but thankfully everything was for the most part sane. I actually ended up getting three of my predictions correct (there was a moving decision with labor supply, an exchange economies question, and a public goods question). I finished the test early but I did read over every question again just to make sure I didn't mess up badly, and I think (god willing) I will end up with an A in the class. Much better result than topology, but also Intermediate Micro isn't an upper div class.

### 11 December, 2022
My mind is still very, very dead from making the economics notes and also working through the practice finals Prof. Ngo gave to us. Additionally, a lot of stuff went wrong on my topology exam, mostly stemming from a complete and utter inability to think during the exam period. I was sure I had eaten enough and even drank chocolate milk during the exam, but the questions were a mixture of curveballs, tedious problems, and the fact that I just didn't prepare for some of the problems. Might be my first B in a math class, which would suck, but I guess the bright side is that I'm done with the class. Even though I really did love the professor, there was just a lot of stuff going on in my life that the completion of the class is a good sign that stuff should (inshallah) become better.

The econ notes are pretty thorough (except for consumer theory — I mostly made this set of notes to double down on producer theory and monopolies). I think the final exam should have some mixture of the following:

- exchange economies question with utility maximization
- non-standard budget constraint or moving decision
- economic rent/situation with different types of producers
- public goods
