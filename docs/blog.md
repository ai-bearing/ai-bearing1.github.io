## Welcome to the blog
This is less of a typical blog and more an online journal where I write down my thoughts on various things that are on my mind at that period in time. I'm going to try to update this regularly. I will try to keep profanity to a minimum, but readers are advised that there will probably be a nonzero amount of profanity.

#### Classes and Finals
My mind is still very, very dead from making the economics notes and also working through the practice finals Prof. Ngo gave to us. Additionally, a lot of stuff went wrong on my topology exam, mostly stemming from a complete and utter inability to think during the exam period. I was sure I had eaten enough and even drank chocolate milk during the exam, but the questions were a mixture of curveballs, tedious problems, and the fact that I just didn't prepare for some of the problems. Might be my first B in a math class, which would suck, but I guess the bright side is that I'm done with the class. Even though I really did love the professor, there was just a lot of stuff going on in my life that the completion of the class is a good sign that stuff should (inshallah) become better.

The econ notes are pretty thorough (except for consumer theory — I mostly made this set of notes to double down on producer theory and monopolies). I think the final exam should have some mixture of the following:

- exchange economies question with utility maximization
- non-standard budget constraint or moving decision
- economic rent/situation with different types of producers
- public goods

I think my main issue with the exchange economies question on the practice exams was that I tried to work too fast. Of course, we are allotted three whole hours to take the final exam, which means that (theoretically speaking), I should be fine on the exam as long as I don't suddenly get the urge to leave as soon as possible.

#### Thoughts on Gentrification and Exclusion
In Los Angeles, there's often talk about "gentrification" (usually a signifier for neighborhood change, typically identified with new housing development, different restaurants, and rising rents) that's leading to people having to leave their communities, with much of the blame placed on the tech industry or new private market rate housing. Of course, I fall firmly on the side that gentrification — to the extent that it's a discussion about rising rents — is resolved via mass construction of housing ([here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3867764) [are](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/doi/10.1162/rest_a_01055/100977/Local-Effects-of-Large-New-Apartment-Buildings-in) [some](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fer/wpaper/146.html) [papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3426103) showing that mass construction of housing does lead to decreasing rents both at the hyperlocal level and at the regional level).
