## About
Hi. I'm Avinash. Welcome to my website! There isn't a lot here, but I promise it's pretty cool nonetheless.


## Who I am
I am a math and econ student at Occidental College. You can find my resume [here](https://github.com/ai-bearing/ai-bearing.github.io/blob/ca7e5c87db3a7564b25812ae86f44b72db9bb3f7/docs/CVDraft.pdf)

## Why is this here?
I figured I needed a website to store and document various things I have done or am doing.

## Things I'm Doing/Have Done
- [Advent of Code](adventofcode.md)
- [Topology Notes](https://aiyer.notion.site/Topology-Final-Exam-Notes-4603c14e5cb94f45a867fca3164d27a5) (for final exams)
