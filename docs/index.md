Hi. I'm Avinash. Welcome to my website! There isn't a lot here, but I promise it's pretty cool nonetheless.

## Who I am
I am a math and econ student at Occidental College. I'm going to be using this website to document some things I've done or am doing. Class notes, blog posts and pontifications, and the like. I hope you find them mildly interesting!

## Interests
- Abstract Algebra and Topology
- Urbanism
- Liberalism
- Weightlifting
- Coffee
- Writing

## What I use
- For hardware, I use a M1 Macbook Air with MacOS Ventura and an iPad 7.
- For notetaking, I used GoodNotes until recently, but starting with finals, I switched to using Notion.
- For math documents, I use LaTeX with NeoVim through the terminal, using [this](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config#Mac-OS-Installation) config with some minor changes.
- I also use NeoVim for programming in Python.
