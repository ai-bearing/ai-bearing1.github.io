Hello, I'll be posting the various opinion pieces I have written that I cannot find a home for here. They'll be in chronological order more or less, but I figured my [microblog](blog.md) location wasn't right for these kinds of things.

### Legalize drugs?
One of my more outlier opinions is that I think we should legalize (almost all) drugs for anyone above the age of 18. The main exceptions where I think there's a strong enough reason for the government to intervene to control this is in the case of antibiotics. And, additionally, I think it would be preferable to get rid of mandated prescription requirements for drugs as well. There's a few reasons why.

According to the doctrine of informed consent, a person is the ultimate person in control of their own body — this means that they're allowed to deny themselves treatment even if doing so may harm them (or even kill them). I don't think that this doctrine should be thrown out of the window when it comes to patients making their own decisions on what drugs they may or may not consume (provided proper information and understanding of risk). This is one of the main arguments put forward by Jessica Flanigan in *Pharmaceutical Freedom* and her associated papers, which are a great resource I recommend everyone read.

I think one of the more severe consequences of restricting the ability for people to self-medicate is twofold:

- consumption of more dangerous drug alternatives
- loss of potential new drugs

For example, we may understand a lot of the current phase of the opioid crisis through the first lens — a lot of people, unable to use prescription opioids for pain management, turned to heroin and then fentanyl, which are much, much more dangerous than prescription opioids themselves. Illegal drugs are harmful *because* they're illegal — drug users cannot get their products certified as safe, or get them tested for harmful substances. There is some movement on this with greater access to fentanyl testing strips, but the drug overdose death rates have still taken a massive toll.

Additionally, the current system of drug regulation (i.e., the Food and Drug Administration's efficacy testing regime after the Kefauver amendments) severely constrains the ability for new drugs to get to market, as well as being time consuming for drugs that eventually do get to market. One of the most infamous examples may be the fact that it took 7 years for azidothymidine, an anti-HIV/AIDS drug, to get to market. Of course part of this is the set of incentives that a FDA regulator has, but it is still quite unconscionable to let drugs or vaccines lay in wait while a crisis is going on. A more recent example might be the vaccines for COVID, which were created only weeks after the discovery of the virus, in January 2020, but still weren't approved for general public use until January 2021.

Of course, you might say that it's worth it to implement this strict system of prescription requirements, criminalization, and drug regulation in order to protect the public. However, at the same time, one of the most dangerous drugs, one with very few if any health benefits, is perfectly legal to consume without prescription for anyone above the age of 21 — alcohol. I personally detest alcohol, but it is very prominent in many cultures, which is why I'm not okay with doing a full on alcohol prohibition.

At the same time, alcohol has major social costs — a paper from South Africa found that their sudden alcohol prohibition during COVID-19 reduced injury-induced mortality by at least [14%](https://bibliothek.wzb.eu/pdf/2022/ii22-301.pdf), and more generally that alcohol [fuels a lot of violence](https://www.nber.org/reporter/fall-2001/alcohol-and-violence#N_5_) in our society. Yet, because our culture is so ingrained in alcohol, we don't prohibit it to the same extent we did COVID vaccines during the pandemic, or antiretrovirals during the AIDS crisis.

I'm not proposing prohibiting alcohol, either. I just want to bring forth the juxtaposition between important drugs that save numbers of lives (and other drugs like adderall that allow people with ADHD to function normally that are also [de facto banned](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/health/adderall-shortage-adhd/index.html)) but were caught up in the arcane system of drug regulation and prescription requirements, and the dangerous drug with major social costs that is so ingrained within our culture that we separate it from "drugs."

Of course, the case of controlling antibiotics is very obvious — namely, consuming antibiotics does affect other people much more than consuming other drugs, which is that overconsumption leads to development of antibiotic resistant bacteria like MRSA.

What would be my solution? It's probably a mixture of the following:

- Remove all drugs from the scheduling of the Controlled Substances Act
- Harmonize FDA approvals with the European Medical Association and Health Canada's HPFB.
- Allow people to consume drugs that aren't approved by the FDA (provided proper informed consent), as well as remove mandates on prescription requirements.
- Allow private companies (similar to Underwriters Laboratory) to certify drugs as safe and effective alongside the FDA.
- Redirect saved money to voluntary addiction treatment.

I'm not one of those types of people who believes that all problems would be solved if only we all smoked cannabis, but I do believe that there are a lot of other, more pressing issues in our society than whether someone consumes a drug that they understand the risks of taking, and directing our resources to those more pressing issues would be more effective.

### Why Steph Curry is no longer my hero
I used to love Steph Curry, NBA MVP, point guard extraordinaire, and darling of the San Francisco Bay Area. To an extent, I really do still view him as one of the greatest players of all time. Additionally, he was not only a great player, but active in movements for racial justice and dignity for all regardless of their skin color, gender, or income level.

Well, there's a reason I say "used to." Steph Curry is [a NIMBY](https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2023/01/27/steph-and-ayesha-curry-oppose-upzoning-of-atherton-property-near-their-home). I don't really care whether it's for privacy reasons (though if I'm being honest, Steph is from Atherton, he's going to be fine if they build some townhouses near his house). He cannot, in good faith, consider himself an advocate for racial justice.

Atherton is a city founded on exclusion — a realtor from there sought to turn the entirety of San Francisco and San Mateo counties into a whites-only sundown town, and even now it is both much whiter and much, much richer than the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area (itself one of the richest parts of the world). Atherton itself used to have a Caltrain station... until they shut it down because they didn't want to face the possibility of (gasp) apartments in their community. The city is built on the belief that if you want to live there, you can only be one of the elite. This might be slightly acceptable... except that Atherton is located within one of the most important metropolitan areas in our technological age. Exclusion on the basis of race (which morphed into exclusion on the basis of class), cannot be allowed.

Steph Curry isn't an idiot — the letter even states that they don't want to use "not in our backyard" language — and he knows that NIMBYism is wrong. No matter to him, because when he finally had the tiniest bit of skin in the game now that he might have to deal with the shock of someone slightly poorer than him living next door, he folded. I'm sorry Steph, I can't think of you as a person in the pursuit of justice anymore. You were always a fraud, and it only took this time to prove it.

Of course, you can always change for the better. Atherton is currently subject to the [Builder's Remedy](https://www.yimbylaw.org/buildersremedy), and you could always commission to turn your house into a large apartment building so many people can live in the exclusive community you currently call home. It's only fair.
