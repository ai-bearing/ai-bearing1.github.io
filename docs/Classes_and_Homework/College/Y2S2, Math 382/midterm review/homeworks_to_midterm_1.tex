\begin{problem}{1.1.10}
   Prove or disprove: the complement of a simple disconnected graph must be connected.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
   Let $G$ be a graph that is disconnected. We want to show that $\forall x,y\in V(G), \exists xz$ path. We can split into two cases.
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Suppose $x\not\leftrightarrow y$ in $G$. Then, in $\overline{G}$, $x\leftrightarrow y$ by the definition of a graph complement.
       \item Suppose $x\leftrightarrow y$ in $G$. Then, since $G$ is disconnected, we know that there must be some $z\in V(G)$ such that there is no $xz$ path. Since there is no $xz$ path, then there is no $yz$ path. In particular, this means $x\not\leftrightarrow z$ and $y\not\leftrightarrow z$ in $G$. Therefore, in $\overline{G}$, we have that $x\leftrightarrow z$ and $y\leftrightarrow z$, meaning there is a path between $x$ and $y$.
     \end{itemize}
\end{solution}
\subsection*{Group}%
\begin{problem}{1.1.13}
    Let $G$ be the graph whose vertex set is the set of $k$-tuples with coordinates $\{0,1\}$, with $x$ adjacent to $y$ if $x$ and $y$ differ by exactly one position. Determine whether $G$ is bipartite.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  $G$ is bipartite --- we can find a bipartition by separating the set into a set of tuples which differ by an even number of positions and a set of tuples which differ by an odd number of positions. Since odd numbers differ from each other by at least $2$ places, and even numbers differ from each other by at least $2$ places, we know that each subset of tuples is not adjacent to each other, but is adjacent to the other set. 
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}{1.1.26}
  Let $G$ be a graph with girth $4$ in which every vertex has degree $k$. Prove that $G$ has at least $2k$ vertices. Determine all such graphs with $2k$ vertices.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  \noindent Suppose $G$ is a graph with girth $4$ with every vertex of degree $k$. Let $v_i\in V(G)$. Then, there must be $k$ vertices which $v_i$ is adjacent to. However, none of these vertices can be adjacent to themselves or $G$ would have girth $3$. Thus, we can form a bipartition such that $v_i$ is in a set of at least $k$ vertices such that each vertex is not adjacent to itself, and each vertex in this set is adjacent to $k$ vertices in a disjoint set where each vertex in this set is not adjacent to any other vertex in this set. Therefore, there are at least $2k$ vertices.\\

  \noindent The graphs with exactly $2k$ vertices are the $K_{n,n}$ complete bipartite graphs.
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}{1.1.27}
    Let $G$ be a graph with girth 5. Prove that if every vertex of $G$ has degree at least $k$, then $G$ has at least $k^2+1$ vertices. For $k=2$ and $k=3$, find one such graph with $k^2+1$ vertices.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  \noindent Let $G$ be a simple graph with girth 5. Suppose that every vertex of $G$ has degree $k$. Let $u\in V(G)$. Then, $u$ has $k$ adjacent vertices, each of which is not adjacent to each other (or else the girth of $G$ would be $3$). Let this set be $N$. The elements of $N$ cannot have any other common neighbors aside from $u$, or else the girth of $G$ would be $4$, meaning each has $k-1$ distinct neighbors. Therefore, the total number of vertices in our graph includes $u$, the elements of $N$ that are the $k$ distinct neighbors of $u$, and the $k(k-1)$ distinct vertices for each vertex in $N$. Therefore, our total is $1 + k + k(k-1) = k^2 + 1$.\\

  \noindent If there were any vertex with degree greater than $k$, then there would be additional vertices beyond the $k^2 + 1$ vertices necessary for a $k$-regular graph.\\

  \noindent For  $k=2$, we have the graph $C_5$ for an example of a graph with $k^2 + 1$ vertices, and for $k=3$ we have the Petersen graph.
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}{1.1.30}
    Let $G$ be a simple graph with adjacency matrix $A$ and incidence matrix $M$. Prove that the degree of $v_i$ is the $i$th diagonal entry of $A^2$ and $MM^T$. What do the entries in position $(i,j)$ of $A^2$ and $MM^T$ say about $G$?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  \noindent Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix for a simple graph $G$. In $A$, every vertex's corresponding row and column are identical, meaning that the entry $A^2_{i,i}$ will be equal to $r_ic_i$ for row $i$ and column $i$ corresponding to $v_i$. Thus, $r_ic_i$ is equal to $|c_i|^2$, which is equal to the sum of the elements of $c_i$, which is equal to the degree of $v_i$.\\

  \noindent Let $M$ be the incidence matrix for a simple graph $G$. In $MM^T$, the diagonal element $MM^T_{i,i}$ will be equal to $r_i r_i^T$, where $r_i$ represents the edge incidence row of $v_i$. This is equal to $\left|r_i^T\right|^2$, which is equal to the sum of the elements of $r_i$, which is equal to the number of edges incident on $v_i$, which is equal to the degree of $v_i$.\\

  \noindent The entry in position $(i,j)$ in both $A^2$ and $MM^T$ shows whether vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ are adjacent to each other.
\end{solution}

    Decompose the Petersen graph into three connected subgraphs that are pairwise isomorphic. Also decompose it into copies of $P_4$.
