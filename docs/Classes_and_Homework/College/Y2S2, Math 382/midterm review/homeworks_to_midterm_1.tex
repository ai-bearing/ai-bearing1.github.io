   Prove or disprove: the complement of a simple disconnected graph must be connected.
   \tcblower
   Let $G$ be a graph that is disconnected. We want to show that $\forall x,y\in V(G), \exists xz$ path. We can split into two cases.
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Suppose $x\not\leftrightarrow y$ in $G$. Then, in $\overline{G}$, $x\leftrightarrow y$ by the definition of a graph complement.
       \item Suppose $x\leftrightarrow y$ in $G$. Then, since $G$ is disconnected, we know that there must be some $z\in V(G)$ such that there is no $xz$ path. Since there is no $xz$ path, then there is no $yz$ path. In particular, this means $x\not\leftrightarrow z$ and $y\not\leftrightarrow z$ in $G$. Therefore, in $\overline{G}$, we have that $x\leftrightarrow z$ and $y\leftrightarrow z$, meaning there is a path between $x$ and $y$.
     \end{itemize}

\begin{problem}{1.1.13}
    Let $G$ be the graph whose vertex set is the set of $k$-tuples with coordinates $\{0,1\}$, with $x$ adjacent to $y$ if $x$ and $y$ differ by exactly one position. Determine whether $G$ is bipartite.
    \tcblower
  $G$ is bipartite --- we can find a bipartition by separating the set into a set of tuples which differ by an even number of positions and a set of tuples which differ by an odd number of positions. Since odd numbers differ from each other by at least $2$ places, and even numbers differ from each other by at least $2$ places, we know that each subset of tuples is not adjacent to each other, but is adjacent to the other set. 
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{1.1.26}
  Let $G$ be a graph with girth $4$ in which every vertex has degree $k$. Prove that $G$ has at least $2k$ vertices. Determine all such graphs with $2k$ vertices.
  \tcblower
  \noindent Suppose $G$ is a graph with girth $4$ with every vertex of degree $k$. Let $v_i\in V(G)$. Then, there must be $k$ vertices which $v_i$ is adjacent to. However, none of these vertices can be adjacent to themselves or $G$ would have girth $3$. Thus, we can form a bipartition such that $v_i$ is in a set of at least $k$ vertices such that each vertex is not adjacent to itself, and each vertex in this set is adjacent to $k$ vertices in a disjoint set where each vertex in this set is not adjacent to any other vertex in this set. Therefore, there are at least $2k$ vertices.\\

  \noindent The graphs with exactly $2k$ vertices are the $K_{n,n}$ complete bipartite graphs.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{1.1.27}
    Let $G$ be a graph with girth 5. Prove that if every vertex of $G$ has degree at least $k$, then $G$ has at least $k^2+1$ vertices. For $k=2$ and $k=3$, find one such graph with $k^2+1$ vertices.
    \tcblower
  \noindent Let $G$ be a simple graph with girth 5. Suppose that every vertex of $G$ has degree $k$. Let $u\in V(G)$. Then, $u$ has $k$ adjacent vertices, each of which is not adjacent to each other (or else the girth of $G$ would be $3$). Let this set be $N$. The elements of $N$ cannot have any other common neighbors aside from $u$, or else the girth of $G$ would be $4$, meaning each has $k-1$ distinct neighbors. Therefore, the total number of vertices in our graph includes $u$, the elements of $N$ that are the $k$ distinct neighbors of $u$, and the $k(k-1)$ distinct vertices for each vertex in $N$. Therefore, our total is $1 + k + k(k-1) = k^2 + 1$.\\

  \noindent If there were any vertex with degree greater than $k$, then there would be additional vertices beyond the $k^2 + 1$ vertices necessary for a $k$-regular graph.\\

  \noindent For  $k=2$, we have the graph $C_5$ for an example of a graph with $k^2 + 1$ vertices, and for $k=3$ we have the Petersen graph.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{1.1.30}
    Let $G$ be a simple graph with adjacency matrix $A$ and incidence matrix $M$. Prove that the degree of $v_i$ is the $i$th diagonal entry of $A^2$ and $MM^T$. What do the entries in position $(i,j)$ of $A^2$ and $MM^T$ say about $G$?
\tcblower
  \noindent Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix for a simple graph $G$. In $A$, every vertex's corresponding row and column are identical, meaning that the entry $A^2_{i,i}$ will be equal to $r_ic_i$ for row $i$ and column $i$ corresponding to $v_i$. Thus, $r_ic_i$ is equal to $|c_i|^2$, which is equal to the sum of the elements of $c_i$, which is equal to the degree of $v_i$.\\

  \noindent Let $M$ be the incidence matrix for a simple graph $G$. In $MM^T$, the diagonal element $MM^T_{i,i}$ will be equal to $r_i r_i^T$, where $r_i$ represents the edge incidence row of $v_i$. This is equal to $\left|r_i^T\right|^2$, which is equal to the sum of the elements of $r_i$, which is equal to the number of edges incident on $v_i$, which is equal to the degree of $v_i$.\\

  \noindent The entry in position $(i,j)$ in both $A^2$ and $MM^T$ shows whether vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ are adjacent to each other.

\begin{problem}{1.2.1}
    Determine whether the following statements are true or false:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Every disconnected graph has an isolated vertex.
        \item A graph is connected if and only if some vertex is connected to all other vertices.
        \item The edge set of every closed trail can be partitioned into edge sets of cycles.
        \item If a maximal trail in a graph is not closed, then its endpoints have odd degree.
      \end{itemize}
      \tcblower
      \begin{itemize}
        \item False; we can imagine a graph with two components, each of which consists of $K_3$, where there are no isolated vertices.
        \item True; since $\forall u,v\in G,\exists u,v$ path by the definition of a connected graph, this means any vertex must have a path to any other vertex.
        \item True; every closed trail contains within it a cycle --- we can delete the edge set of this cycle, and find cycles within remaining components until we reach isolated vertices.
        \item True; if there were a maximal trail with an endpoint of even degree, then we would be able to extend the trail further by re-entering the endpoint vertex.
      \end{itemize}
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{1.2.5}
    Let $v$ be a vertex of a connected simple graph $G$. Prove that $v$ has a neighbor in every component of $G-v$. Explain why this allows us to conclude that no graph has a cut-vertex of degree 1.   
    \tcblower
    Suppose that $G-v$ is connected. Then, since $G$ is connected, and $v\in V(G)$, it must be the case that $v$ is connected to every component of $G-v$, meaning that it has a neighbor in every component of $G-v$ as $G-v$ is connected.\\

    Now suppose that $G-v$ is disconnected, meaning that it has more than one component after removing $v$. Before, $v$ must have been connected to every vertex in $G$ as $G$ was a simple connected graph, and afterwards $G-v$ is no longer connected, meaning that $v$ is a cut-vertex. This means $v$ must have been adjacent to a vertex in each component of $G-v$, as removing the incident edges on $v$ along with $v$ increased the number of components from the original $1$ that was in $G$.\\

    From this result, we can conclude that no cut-vertex has degree $1$ as removing a vertex of degree $1$ and its incident edges does not increase the number of components in $G$, since there is only one edge incident on a vertex of degree $1$.

        Let $G$ be an Eulerian bipartite graph. Since $G$ is Eulerian, it must contain an Eulerian cycle, meaning that as seen above, there are an even number of vertices, meaning that there are an even number of edges in $G$. 
      \end{tcolorbox}

      \begin{tcolorbox}[colback = white, title = (b)]
        Let $G$ be an Eulerian simple graph with an even number of vertices. Since $G$ is Eulerian, this means there must be an Eulerian circuit $C$ that traverses every edge exactly once in $G$. Every vertex in $G$ must have even degree (or else we would require a backtrack in our Eulerian cycle, which is not a circuit); a simple pairing of the vertices would yield that we have $\lfloor n/2\rfloor $ edges, and to complete the cycle we need $2(n/2) + 2k$ edges for $n$ vertices and some integer $k$. Therefore, there must be an even number of edges.

  Let $v$ be a cut-vertex of a simple graph $G$. Prove that $\overline{G} - v$ is connected.
  \tcblower
  Let $x,y,v\in V(\overline{G})$, where $v$ is a cut-vertex of $G$.\\

  Suppose $x$ and $y$ belong to distinct components of $G-v$. Then, $xy\not\in E(G)$, meaning that $xy\in E(\overline{G})$, meaning there is an $x,y$ path in $\overline{G}$, so there is an $x,y$ path in $\overline{G}-v$.\\

  Suppose $x$ and $y$ are in the same component of $G-v$. Since $v$ is a cut-vertex, this means there must be at least two components in $G-v$. Let $H_1$ be the component that $x,y$ are in, while $\exists w\in H_2$ is a vertex in $H_2$ disjoint from $H_1$. Since $H_1$ and $H_2$ are disjoint, this means the components do not contain any edges between them, so $x\not\leftrightarrow w$ and $y\not\leftrightarrow w$ in $G-v$ --- however, this means that $x\leftrightarrow w$ and $y\leftrightarrow w$ in $\overline{G}$, meaning that $\exists x,y$ path in $\overline{G} - v$.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{1.2.22}
  Prove that a graph is connected if and only if for every partition of its vertices into two nonempty sets, there is an edge with endpoints in both sets. 
  \tcblower
  Let $G$ be a graph where there exists a partition of its vertices into two non-empty sets such that there is no edge with endpoints in both sets. Call these sets $A$ and $B$. By our assumptions, $\forall u\in A$ and $\forall v\in B$, $\nexists e$ such that $e = uv$. Therefore, we cannot create a path between any $u\in A$ and any $v\in B$ as there is no edge to connect any element in $A$ and any element in $B$. Therefore, $G$ is disconnected.\\

  Suppose $G$ is a disconnected graph. Then, $G$ contains more than one component --- we can create a partition of $V(G)$ by letting $H_1,H_2,\dots,H_k$ refer to the $k$ components of $G$. Each of these components is necessarily disjoint from every other component. By taking $H = H_1\cup H_2\cup\dots\cup H_{k-1}$ as one set and $H_k$ as our other set, we know that $H_1,\dots,H_k$ are all disjoint, meaning that $H$ and $H_k$ are disjoint, meaning that there is no edge connecting any vertex $H$ with any vertex in $H_k$, meaning we have created a partition of $G$ such that there exists no edge between any vertex in one set and any vertex in the other set.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{1.2.26}
  Prove that a graph $G$ is bipartite if and only if every subgraph $H$ of $G$ has an independent set consisting of at least half of $V(H)$.
  \tcblower
  Suppose $G$ is bipartite. Then, there exists a partition of the vertices $V = X\sqcup Y$ such that $X$ and $Y$ are independent sets. Let $H$ be a subgraph of $G$, and let $H_X = X\cap V(H)$ and $H_Y = Y\cap H$. Because $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, each vertex of $H$ must be an element of either $H_X$ or $H_Y$, or that $V(H) = H_X \sqcup H_Y$. WLOG, let $|H_X|>|H_Y|$. Since $H_X\subseteq X$ and $X$ is an independent set, $H_X$ is an independent subset consisting of at least half of $V(H)$.\\

  Suppose every subgraph of $G$ has an independent set consisting of at least half of $V(H)$. We will suppose toward contradiction that $G$ is not bipartite. Then, $G$ must contain an odd cycle, $H_1$. However, an independent set of $H_1$ consists of at most $\lfloor \frac{|V(H_1)|}{2}\rfloor < \frac{|V(H_1)|}{2}$, otherwise two vertices would be adjacent. Because $H_1$ is an independent set with less than half of the elements of $V(H)$, we have reached a contradiction. Therefore, $G$ must be bipartite.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}{1.2.38}
  Prove that every $n$-vertex graph with at least $n$ edges contains a cycle.
  \tcblower
  We proceed via induction as follows:\\

  For the base case where $|V(G)| = 1$, we know that there is a cycle with one edge that connects back on the vertex.\\

  For the case where $|V(G)| > 1$, if $v\in V(G)$ has degree at most $1$, then $G-v$ has $n-1$ vertices and at least $n-1$ edges, so by our inductive hypothesis, we know that $G-v$ contains a cycle. Meanwhile, if $\forall v\in V(G), d(v)\geq 2$, we know by Lemma 1.2.25 that $G$ contains a cycle.
