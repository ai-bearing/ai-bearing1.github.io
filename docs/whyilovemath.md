If I'm being honest, I wasn't particularly adept at high school (or rather, I don't think I was uniquely adept at math compared to other subjects) — my AMC scores in high school were, for lack of a better word, extremely bad, and while I had good grades, I was mostly coasting off YouTube videos and various other snippets of knowledge I had accrued over the years. In fact, I didn't even take a formal math class my senior year of high school, and I was seriously considering doing a physics major.

I had a lot of anxiety going into college surrounding doing a math major — my self esteem was pretty low thanks to the high school I went to having been a very competitive outfit with lots of genuinely bright people, and I thought I would not be able to excel in my math classes to the point of doing a math major. I have a tendency to become single-mindedly obsessed with certain things (such as my math grades), and become worried about them to an unhealthy degree. At the beginning of college, I figured that I'd just take Linear Algebra to satisfy general education requirements.

Thankfully, Linear Algebra wasn't anything like the overly competitive and insufferable mess that was high school math class. I saw that math was more than just trying to solve an integral within a five minute window (yes, that was a part of my math class), but more like building a Lego set, with the focus on synthesizing various facts to prove something new. I didn't see this from math during high school because, well, they cared mostly about breaking us down rather than building a healthy appreciation for the subject.

Regardless, without further adieu, these are the top reasons I love math:

## Thought Process
Math, like a lot of subjects, is primarily (in my opinion) about teaching someone to think. Consider a question like "prove that a closed subset of a compact topological space is compact." To solve a question like this, we need to:

- know the definition of compactness (any open cover of a set has a finite subcover)
- know the definition of closed (complement is open)
- construct an open cover of our closed subset
- show that this open cover has a finite subcover
-
This question draws on memorized definitions, their specific applications, and using a little bit of ingenuity to construct the specific open cover that solves our problem.

Of course, this is true of nearly every subject, but math is, in a sense, arbitrary (thanks, Gödel's incompleteness theorem). Maybe some think "well that sucks, you're studying a subject that isn't completely real," but I think that's where the fun is. Math is less of something meant to describe reality (though it does do that a lot), but a process of discovering based on certain rules that don't necessarily have to be the way we set out.

In today's world, where so much can change in a short amount of time, I think it's awesome there is an entire subject about following certain axioms to their various consequences, rather than focusing on specific processes that could change at any point in time.

## Difficulty
It seems odd to say that I like math because it's difficult, and you'd be right that I don't think it's fun because it's difficult. I think it's fun because it _seems_ difficult, and then as we undergo the discovery process, they gradually become easier, and then after a certain point you look back and think "wow, I thought that was hard?"

In Topology, we spent a _long_ amount of time in the lead-up to the first exam practicing the proof that the preimage of open sets is open under a continuous map. Now, of course, I'm done with the semester and we've covered topics a lot more challenging than continuous maps (like path connectedness and manifolds). With the more difficult content ahead, it's often surprising to look back and think that we spent so much time on concepts that look so easy now — of course, this isn't surprising because they're difficult topics, but as math becomes more difficult, it's always fun to look back and see where we came from.

Math is difficult in the moment, but as concepts become clear and you build off of them, the satisfaction of looking back and seeing where you came from is unparalleled. I'm an economics major as well, but economics never created the same feelings of joy and excitement that math does, primarily because there are so many more fields of math.

## It's just plain fun
The group of math majors at my college are just great people, and I love spending time with them. There's not much more to it.
